## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6+)

- `Country-Code.xlsx`: A dataset providing country codes and names.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves handling missing values and merging the main dataset with country codes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis includes the following steps:

- Identifying missing values and handling them.
- Exploring numerical and categorical variables.
- Finding relationships between features.
- Visualizing data using various charts and plots.

## Findings

Here are some key findings from the analysis:

- Maximum Zomato transactions are from India, followed by the USA and the UK.
- The distribution of ratings and rating colors is visualized.
- Countries with zero ratings are identified.
- Information about which currency is used by each country is provided.
- Countries with online delivery options are listed.
- A pie chart shows the distribution of cities.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis.
